# Scalable E-commerce Platform (Microservices)

**Last Updated:** May 9, 2025

## Description

This project is a scalable e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The goal is to create a modular, resilient, and independently deployable system that can handle various aspects of an online store, including product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, payment processing, and order management. Each core feature is implemented as a separate microservice.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Initial Development & Setup

The project is currently in the early stages of development. Core microservices are being defined and initial MVP (Minimum Viable Product) versions are being built. Docker and Docker Compose are being used for local development and orchestration.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot (Java)
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Docker Compose
* **Architecture:** Microservices
* **Database (Initial):** PostgreSQL (This may vary per microservice in the future, e.g., MongoDB for specific use cases)
* **Version Control:** Git

### Planned Technologies (To be integrated)

* **API Gateway:** (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, NGINX, Traefik)
* **Service Discovery:** (e.g., Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka, Consul)
* **Centralized Logging:** (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or Grafana Loki)
* **Monitoring:** (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
* **Message Queue (for asynchronous communication):** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)
* **CI/CD:** (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
* **Production Deployment:** (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)

## Core Microservices

The platform is composed of the following core microservices:

* **User Service:** Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* **Product Catalog Service:** Manages product listings, categories, and inventory.
* **Shopping Cart Service:** Manages usersâ€™ shopping carts, including adding/removing items and updating quantities.
* **Order Service:** Processes orders, including placing orders, tracking order status, and managing order history.
* **Payment Service:** Handles payment processing, integrating with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
* **Notification Service:** Sends email and SMS notifications for various events (e.g., order confirmation, shipping updates via Twilio, SendGrid, etc.).

## Additional Components (Planned)

* **API Gateway:** Single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
* **Service Discovery:** Allows services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.
* **Centralized Configuration:** Manage configuration for all microservices from a central place.
* **Centralized Logging & Monitoring:** Aggregate logs and metrics for observability and troubleshooting.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate the build, test, and deployment process for each microservice.
